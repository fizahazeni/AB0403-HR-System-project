# Features/functionalities of the HR System Prototype

## Create Account & Login
Through this feature, we are enabling employees to create an account using the HR System
as well as allow existing employees to login to view customised information.
When a new employee is first creating an account, the system will prompt them with
questions that will be eventually updated into the system.
With the use of a Login Feature, we will then only limit employees to have access to our HR
System which increases security.

## Updating New Information
Through this feature, HR employees will be able to add in information into the system for new
employees such as their Salaries as well as their Status in the company. This feature, hence,
allows HR employees to input data into the system which other employees are not authorised
to do so.

## Edit Existing Information
Through this feature, HR employees will be able to edit existing information that was inputted
by the employees when they create an account. This feature will allow HR employees to edit
any information that is inaccurate as well as update information along the way. Moreover, this
feature will allow HR to edit employees who are joining as a new Team Manager, where their
“Pending Team Managers” status to be edited accordingly.

## Reset Password
This feature will allow HR employees to reset password of employees upon request.

## Removal of Account
This feature will enable HR employees to remove accounts from the system. An example of
such occurrence would be when an employee has left the organisation.

## Leave Approval
This feature will create an outlet for HR employees to “Approve” or “Reject” leave requests
from employees. When utilising this feature, the HR employee will be given a list of
employees whom leaves are yet to be validated. The system will then systematically request
HR employee to “Approve” or “Reject”.

## Handling My Leave
This feature will allow all employees to apply for leave where the system will request the
planned starting date as well as the ending date. The system will not allow the employee to
input dates on weekends as well as dates that are past the today’s date and will be requested
to re-input.

## Bonus System
This feature will allow HR employee to pass through bonus amounts for employees based on
the grades that are given by Team Managers for employees that are within their team. After
running this feature, the HR employee will be able to see the list of employees whom bonus
amounts are updated, which will eventually be saved into the system.

## View Your Info
This feature allows every individual employee to view their own information which includes
sensitive data such as Area, Region, username as well as password. This will be useful in the
event where the employee wants to overlook their information in their system before
requesting HR to update any information.

## View Your Team Structure
This feature allows only Team Managers to view information of every individual within the
team. However, they will not be allowed to view information that the system deems to be
“confidential” such as an employee’s password.

## Rewards System
This feature will allow Team Managers to grade the employees within their team with a grade
as good as “A” and as bad as “F”. With the grades given here, the grade will be used by the
HR employee, in order to calculate the final bonus amount allocated to different employees.

## Exit System
This feature is crucial as it has to be used after every use in the system in order for the
system to catch the changes/updates done by each individual using the system.
Therefore, after using the system, you must “Exit System” in order for the data to be updated,
or else, nothing will be captured.
